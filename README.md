Firefly-Simulated Annealing Algorithm

This is just a Node.JS version of my undergraduate thesis. I just coded this out of boredom and to allow me to revisit Javascript coding from time to time.

Currently it solves the Spring Problem, one of the many engineering problems out there
Feel free to check this out and let me know if there's a problem on my version.
